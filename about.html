           <h1>About Me</h1>

           <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
               I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado with my wife, two dogs, and cat. We have an awesome view of Pikes Peak and the Front Range Mountains out our kitchen window, and it is our cozy little Colorado paradise. I am currently wrapping up my 10th and final year as an elementary school teacher. I'm very excited about all of the web development skills I have been acquiring and refining. I eagerly look forward to eventually landing my first web development position upon finishing the CareerFoundry bootcamp. Life is good!
            </p>
            
                

            <h2>Why I became a web developer...</h2>
            <p>
               I became a web developer because I enjoy working with code, and it is an incredibly useful skillset. There is also a ton of jobs out there for web development, so that is a nice, secure feeling. I also, however, really enjoy solving the code puzzles. I feel that I am a tinkerer and coding speaks to my need to figure things out. The satisfaction from overcoming coding obstacles and putting together cool applications and web pages is about unbeatable for me.
            </p>
                
            <h2>As for the the lighter things... aka my hobbies!!</h2>
            <p>
               My number one hobby is skiing. Zooming down a run with the Rockies standing mightily in the backdrop is an unrivalled experience for me. It is surreal everytime for me, so I try to go at least once a week! Other than that, I like hanging out with my amazing friends and family. My friends and I enjoy music and a lot of us are musicians. I am a passionate guitarist and drummer. We also like to play video games such as Smash Bros and Starcraft 2. But, generally speaking, our favorite activities are the things that get us out exploring this amazing state: hiking, festivals, skiing, camping, kayaking, etc...
